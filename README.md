# CVS-GCP-HPC-Module
This module creates the cloud volumes based on a cloud volumes service in GCP that are available through the web UI and RESTful APIs. The APIs enable you to create and manage cloud volumes programmatically. They also provide the capability to develop scripts and tools for provisioning and support other service workflows.
